# python-yahoofantasy-nhl

This is a Python script to automate player analysis of players in a Yahoo NHL Fantasy league's free agent pool. 

It's able to get a list of your league's free agents and retrieve data from NHL APIs to perform analysis on the free agents so you can find hidden gems in free agency. This was made because I found Yahoo Fantasy's stat tracking to be subpar and I found myself externally looking for stats manually, so I thought I'd automate the process.
